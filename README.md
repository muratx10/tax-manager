- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally on device
- **No Cloud Dependency**: Works offline except for exchange rate updates

## API Integration

### Banking API Integration
- **Endpoint**: Official banking API for exchange rates
- **Rate Limits**: Respects API rate limiting policies
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for network issues
- **Caching**: Rates cached locally to reduce API calls

## Security & Privacy

### Sandboxing
- **App Sandbox**: Enabled for security
- **Network Access**: Limited to banking API endpoints
- **File Access**: User-selected files only
- **Data Protection**: All data stored locally

### Entitlements
- `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`: ‚úÖ Enabled
- `com.apple.security.network.client`: ‚úÖ Enabled
